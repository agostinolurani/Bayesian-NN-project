# BayesianNN
Implementation of Bayesian Neural Networks for an X-Ray Covid Dataset

## Structure

## Dataset

```
## External packages

Both Bayesian Neural Networks are implemented using Torch, in the HamiltonianMonteCarlo.py implementation we used the external package Hamiltorch and in the Variational Inference  Pyro. The classical Neural Network was implemented using Keras.

To install the packages you have to execute the following commands:

```
pip install keras
pip install pyro
pip install git+https://github.com/AdamCobb/hamiltorch
pip install pyro-ppl
```
